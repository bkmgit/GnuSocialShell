Autoconf
--------

To influence the build process, edit only two files,
* configure.ac
* Makefile.am
from which the rest is auto-generated after checkout by running "autoreconf". Settings like toggling support for various libraries (readline), and install paths, are controlled by the autogenerated ./configure script which also remembers these settings.
